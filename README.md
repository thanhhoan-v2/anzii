## Recent Updates

### Next.js 15 & React 19 Upgrade (Latest)

- **Latest Framework**: Upgraded to Next.js 15.4.5 and React 19.1.1 for improved performance and features
- **Enhanced TypeScript Support**: Updated TypeScript configurations for better type safety
- **Updated Dependencies**: Upgraded key dependencies including react-day-picker, next-themes, and testing libraries
- **Improved Build Performance**: Faster compilation and better optimization with the latest Next.js features
- **Better Developer Experience**: Enhanced development tools and debugging capabilities

### Unlimited Review Access

- **No More Limited Trials**: Removed the "due today" filtering - all cards are now available for review at any time
- **Seamless Review Experience**: Users can start reviewing any deck without needing to click "restart" to access all cards
- **Improved Accessibility**: All cards in a deck are immediately available for review, regardless of their due date
- **Better Learning Flow**: Users can review cards multiple times in a session without artificial restrictions

### Embedded Review Sessions

- **Dashboard Overview**: Dashboard shows deck cards with links to detail pages and management actions
- **Deck Detail Pages**: Each deck has a dedicated detail page (`/deck/[deckId]`) with settings, reset, and start review buttons
- **Embedded Review Sessions**: Review sessions are embedded within the deck detail page - no separate review page needed
- **Seamless Experience**: Users stay on the same page when starting and completing review sessions
- **Improved UX**: All deck management and review functionality in one unified interface

## Project Structure

- `src/app/` â€“ Next.js 15.4.5 app router pages and API routes
- `src/components/` â€“ Reusable UI components and feature modules
- `src/db/` â€“ Database schema, migrations, and seed data (Drizzle ORM)
- `src/ai/` â€“ AI integration flows for flashcard generation (Google Gemini)
- `src/hooks/` â€“ Custom React hooks for state management and React Query
- `src/lib/` â€“ Utility functions, constants, and core logic

## React Query Integration

Anzii uses [TanStack Query (React Query)](https://tanstack.com/query/latest) for efficient data fetching, caching, and state management:

### Key Features

- **Optimized Caching**: 5-minute stale time with automatic background refetching
- **Error Boundaries**: Graceful error handling with user-friendly fallbacks
- **Optimistic Updates**: Instant UI updates for better user experience
- **Loading Animations**: Smooth skeleton loading with shimmer effects and rotating icons
- **DevTools**: Built-in development tools for debugging queries and mutations

### Architecture

- **Query Keys**: Centralized in `src/lib/query-keys.ts` for consistency
- **Custom Hooks**: Domain-specific hooks in `src/hooks/use-decks.ts` and `src/hooks/use-cards.ts`
- **Provider Setup**: QueryClient configured in `src/app/providers.tsx`
- **Error Handling**: QueryErrorBoundary component for error boundaries
- **UI Feedback**: Custom AnimatedSkeleton components with shimmer and fade animations

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js 18+](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)
- [PostgreSQL database](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) (or [Neon](https://neon.tech/) for cloud)
- [Google Gemini API key](https://ai.google.dev/) for AI features

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/anzii.git
   cd anzii
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```

   Configure your `.env.local`:

   ```env
   DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@host/database"
   GEMINI_API_KEY="your-gemini-api-key"
   ```

4. **Set up the database**

   ```bash
   pnpm db:generate
   pnpm db:migrate
   pnpm db:seed  # Optional: Add sample data
   ```

5. **Start the development server**

   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

   The application will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

6. **Run tests** (Optional)

   ```bash
   # Unit tests
   pnpm test

   # E2E tests
   pnpm test:e2e

   # All tests
   pnpm test:all
   ```
