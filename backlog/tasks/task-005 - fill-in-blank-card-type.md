## Description

Implement fill-in-the-blank card type where users must complete missing words or phrases. This supports active recall in a different format and is particularly useful for language learning and memorizing specific terms.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Fill-in-the-blank card creation interface
- [ ] Support for multiple blanks per card
- [ ] Flexible answer matching (exact, partial, case-insensitive)
- [ ] Hint system for difficult blanks
- [ ] Auto-generation of blanks from text content
- [ ] Fill-in-the-blank review interface
- [ ] Scoring system with partial credit options
- [ ] AI generation of fill-in-the-blank cards

## Implementation Plan

- Design fill-in-the-blank data schema
- Create card creation UI with blank marking tools
- Implement answer validation with multiple matching options
- Build review interface with input fields for blanks
- Add AI capability to generate blanks from content
- Integrate with spaced repetition scoring system

## Notes & Comments

Consider implementing intelligent blank selection that targets key concepts rather than random words. Support for mathematical expressions and special characters in blanks.
