## Description

Expand the current import system to support additional file formats including LaTeX/Math expressions, enhanced Markdown processing, plain text files, and JSON imports. This will make Anzii more versatile for different academic and professional use cases.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] LaTeX/Math expression import and rendering
- [ ] Enhanced Markdown import with better parsing
- [ ] Plain text file import with intelligent card extraction
- [ ] JSON file import with flexible schema support
- [ ] Math equation rendering in cards (MathJax/KaTeX)
- [ ] Batch import processing for large files
- [ ] Import validation and error handling
- [ ] Format detection and auto-conversion

## Implementation Plan

- Integrate MathJax or KaTeX for LaTeX rendering
- Enhance Markdown parser with additional features
- Implement plain text processing with AI card extraction
- Design flexible JSON import schema
- Create unified import interface with format selection
- Add validation and error reporting for imports

## Notes & Comments

LaTeX support is crucial for STEM subjects. Consider supporting both inline and display math modes. JSON import should be flexible enough to handle exports from other flashcard applications.
