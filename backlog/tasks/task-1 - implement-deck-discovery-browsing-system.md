## Description

Create a comprehensive deck discovery and browsing system that allows users to find, explore, and evaluate flashcard decks created by other users or generated by AI. This system will include intelligent search capabilities, curated popular decks, filtering options, user ratings, and the ability to copy decks for personal use.

The deck browser will serve as a central hub for content discovery, helping users find high-quality study materials across various topics and subjects, while providing social proof through ratings and usage statistics.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AI-powered deck search with semantic matching and keyword filtering
- [ ] Curated collection of pre-generated popular decks across various academic topics
- [ ] Advanced filtering system (by topic, difficulty, rating, popularity)
- [ ] Deck preview functionality showing sample cards
- [ ] One-click deck copying to personal library
- [ ] Star rating system (1-5 stars) for user feedback
- [ ] Usage statistics display (number of active users studying each deck)
- [ ] Responsive grid/list view for deck browsing
- [ ] Deck thumbnails and metadata display
- [ ] Pagination or infinite scroll for large result sets

## Implementation Plan

- Design deck discovery UI with search, filters, and grid layout
- Implement AI-powered search using semantic similarity for deck content
- Create database schema for deck ratings and usage statistics
- Build filtering system with topic categorization and metadata
- Develop deck copying functionality with user permission handling
- Implement rating system with anti-spam measures
- Create curated deck generation system for popular topics
- Add deck preview modal with sample card display
- Integrate with user authentication for personalized recommendations

## Notes & Comments

Consider implementing trending algorithms to surface popular and high-quality content. The search should balance relevance with quality ratings. Privacy controls should allow deck creators to opt out of public discovery while maintaining private sharing options.
