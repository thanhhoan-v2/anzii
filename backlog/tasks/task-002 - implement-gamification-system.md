## Description

Implement a comprehensive gamification system to increase user engagement and motivation. This includes XP points for study activities, achievement badges, daily study goals, leaderboards for competition, and potential reward systems.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] XP point system for study activities (reviewing cards, completing sessions, streaks)
- [ ] Badge system with various achievement categories
- [ ] Daily/weekly study goal setting and tracking
- [ ] Leaderboard system (global and friend-based)
- [ ] Prize/reward system integration
- [ ] Gamification dashboard in user profile
- [ ] Notification system for achievements

## Implementation Plan

- Design XP calculation algorithm based on study activities
- Create badge database with achievement conditions
- Implement goal-setting interface and progress tracking
- Build leaderboard with privacy controls
- Integrate with user profile and dashboard

## Notes & Comments

Consider user privacy preferences for leaderboards and social features. Research best practices in educational gamification to ensure features promote learning rather than just engagement.
