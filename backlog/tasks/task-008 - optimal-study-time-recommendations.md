## Description

Analyze user performance patterns to recommend optimal study times when users are most likely to perform well. Use machine learning to identify patterns in accuracy, speed, and retention based on time of day, day of week, and other factors.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Performance data collection across different times
- [ ] Analysis of user performance patterns
- [ ] AI-powered optimal time recommendations
- [ ] Personalized study schedule suggestions
- [ ] Integration with calendar and reminder systems
- [ ] Performance visualization dashboard
- [ ] Recommendations based on card difficulty and type
- [ ] Adaptive learning that improves over time

## Implementation Plan

- Design performance tracking data model
- Implement analytics collection during study sessions
- Create pattern recognition algorithms for time analysis
- Build recommendation engine using performance data
- Design UI for displaying study time recommendations
- Integrate with existing calendar and notification systems

## Notes & Comments

Consider user privacy and allow opt-out of data collection. Recommendations should account for user's timezone and lifestyle patterns. Machine learning model should improve accuracy over time with more data.
