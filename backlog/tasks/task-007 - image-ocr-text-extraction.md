## Description

Add OCR (Optical Character Recognition) capability to extract text from uploaded images and automatically generate flashcards. This will allow users to quickly digitize handwritten notes, textbook pages, and other printed materials.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Image upload interface with preview
- [ ] OCR text extraction from images
- [ ] Support for multiple image formats (JPG, PNG, PDF)
- [ ] Handwriting recognition capability
- [ ] Text cleanup and formatting after extraction
- [ ] AI-powered card generation from extracted text
- [ ] Manual text correction interface
- [ ] Batch processing for multiple images

## Implementation Plan

- Integrate OCR service (Google Vision API, Tesseract, or similar)
- Create image upload and processing interface
- Implement text extraction and cleanup algorithms
- Add manual correction tools for OCR results
- Connect to AI card generation system
- Design batch processing workflow for efficiency

## Notes & Comments

Consider offering both cloud-based and local OCR options for privacy concerns. Handwriting recognition may need specialized models. Research accuracy rates and user expectations for OCR quality.
